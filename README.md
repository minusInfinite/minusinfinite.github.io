I enjoy tinkering with a number of tools, programing laguages and more. 
I've found it fun to make little desktop apps in the Customisation tool [Rainmeter](https://rainmeter.com)

Here is my [Simple Forecast](https://github.com/minusInfinite/simple_forecast) skin.

Current completing a Bootcamp programme to get over the wall of learning that is modern webdev and full-stack development.
It has been a interesting challenge and a good way of getting into the deepend and not just giving up and going back to a game.
