# About Ashley Mann, aka [minusInfinite](https://minusinfinite.github.io/)

I enjoy tinkering with a number of tools, programing laguages and more.
I've found it fun to make little desktop apps in the Customisation tool [Rainmeter](https://rainmeter.com)

Here is my [Simple Forecast](https://github.com/minusInfinite/simple_forecast) skin.

Current completing a Bootcamp programme to get over the wall of learning that is modern webdev and full-stack development.
It has been a interesting challenge and a good way of getting into the deepend and not just giving up and going back to a game.

During this course I've made the following project:

- [ShazTXT](https://www.minusinfinite.id.au/shaztxt) - Music search via Genus API with links to Youtube content - <https://github.com/minusInfinite/project-1>
- [Weather Dashboard](https://minusinfinite.github.io/weather-dashboard/) - A neat dashboard to display weather data from OpenWeatherMap.org - <https://github.com/minusInfinite/weather-dashboard>
- [Code Quiz](https://minusinfinite.github.io/js-coding-quiz) - A simple JS application that builds a Javascript quiz - <https://github.com/minusInfinite/js-coding-quiz>
